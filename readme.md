# ❓❓ Guess the Number Game ❓❓ 

Welcome to the Guess the Number game! 🎉 This is a fun and simple text-based game with an interactive interface where you try to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100. The game includes hints, limited attempts, and a user-friendly Text User Interface (TUI) to keep you engaged! 😄

## 📜 Description

This project is a **Rust** implementation of the classic "Guess the Number" game. The program generates a random number between 0 and 100, and the player must guess it within 7 attempts. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Players are also offered up to 3 hints to assist them during the game.

This program was built and tested on a **64-bit Windows system** using the `pancurses` library for the interface.

## ✨ Features

- 🎲 **Random number generation** between 0 and 100.
